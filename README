(Proxy Voting, Java)


This git repository will contain the code of my Bachelor-Thesis.
Its about Proxy Voting with improved anonymity.

Using: Java, Tomcat, JaxB, WebServices, JPA2.0 (to MySQL), XMLEncryption, XMLSignature, KeyStores, DOM-Parser

There are 3 Types of Servers:
- ElectionServer: Serves Election Information
- BallotSigner: Authentifies the User and Signes the Vote(XML) so it is valid.
- VotingServer: Stores and publishes the Vote.
Also there is a Client:
- ElecitonUserClient: that uses all of these Servers for the end-user
There are some Libraries because they are needed in more projects:
- BallotSignerClient: WebServiceClient of BallotSigner
- ElectionClient: WebServiceClient of ElectionServer
- VotingClient: WebServiceCLient of VotingServer
- VotingSecurity: Provides XMLEncryption, XMLSignature, XMLHelpers, PropertyReader, KeyStore,...

Basically everything is working, but it is not that easy to configure the Servers. For example the connection.properties-File of the VotingServer has to be stored in the tomcat-bin folder. Detail instructions will be published soon.
